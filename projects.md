# Lockium
Lockium is a bot for Discord (Messaging/Communication App) that lists items that users want to sell or buy as trades.
These trades can be viewed by anyone, so that they can buy/sell their desired items. Lockium is built with Java, using
[JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/jda) and [BotCommands](https://github.com/freya022/BotCommands/).

Hey there, I just wanted to test highlight.js :)

```scala 3
val fruits =
  List("apple", "banana", "avocado", "papaya")

val countsToFruits = // count how many 'a' in each fruit
  fruits.groupBy(fruit => fruit.count(_ == 'a'))

for (count, fruits) <- countsToFruits do
  println(s"with 'a' Ã— $count = $fruits")
```
